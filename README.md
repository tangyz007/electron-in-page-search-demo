# electron-find-in-page demo
Electron doesn't support in-page-search by default and there is no hotkey for in-page-search. I found it would be useful to have this feature so I implemented
this Find-in-page demo in Electron without using npm electron-find or electron-find-in-page. Hope this will help you!
# usage
git clone https://github.com/tangyz007/electron-in-page-search-demo.git
cd electron-in-page-search-demo
npm install
npm run
